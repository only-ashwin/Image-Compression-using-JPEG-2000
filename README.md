# Image-Compression-using-JPEG-2000
Hello Geeks! this is an image compression project based on DWT compression technique.
It uses lossless compression technique for data compression.
It works for both colored and grey scale images.
I have included my project report and the source code inside this file and also my presentation for a clear understanding of the project.
Enjoy your day !!!!
